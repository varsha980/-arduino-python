**DESCRIPTION ABOUT MQ2 SENSOR AND THE CONNECTION OF ARDUINO.....


*he MQ2 gas sensor is a chemiresistor. That is, it contains a sensing material whose resistance changes when it comes 
 in contact with a gas.This change in the value of resistance is used for the detection of gas.

*The sensing element is made of mainly aluminium-oxide based ceramic, coated with Tin dioxide, enclosed in a stainless steel mesh. 
This tutorial is mainly for showing the physical features of this sensor and how to connect it to the Arduino.

*The mq2 gas sensor is connected to the Arduino board as shown in the schematic below. Pins AO and DO of the sensor are connected to Arduino pins A0 and 8 respectively.
 We have included a buzzer on pin 10 for sounding an alarm when the threshold has been breached 
 
 **NOTE: if we want to see the output values in python idle..then you can simply make use of pyserial module in python and import package and integrate it....
